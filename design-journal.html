        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response:<br> In this class I hope to advance my web design expertise and learn how to integrate interactive elements. I would also like to learn how to code hamburger menus, dropdown menus, and parallax scrolling.</p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: <br> For my project, I am planning on focusing on a hardcore band I enjoy called Knocked Loose. For content, I plan to give a brief overview of the band, their singles and demos, their first EP <i>Pop Culture</i> and their two studio albums <i>Laugh Tracks</i> and <i>A Different Shade of Blue</i>. Each page will be unique in content and photography, while staying cohesive in layout in the album-related pages. I plan to use a black, white, and blue color palette, bold typography, and gritty black and white concert photos to give the feeling of the band and recall thhe palette of their newest album, <i>A Different Shade of Blue</i>.</p>

        <h2>Week Four</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Considering the articles you read, make a list of 5 things to keep you going when you feel resistance or discomfort.</p>
        <p>Response:<br> When I feel resistances in general, I remember that I need to get past them to complete my tasks. When it comes to stress, I 
        constantly remember my public speaking instructor explaining the importance of stress in our lives and how it is what keeps us productive. However, too 
        much stress is unhealthy and hinders productivity, so I force myself to take short breaks when I need them. If I feel like one task is taking up too much 
        of my brainpower, I create checklists to ensure that I don't forget my other tasks. If I find myself stumped on something, I will try to talk my way through 
      the issue myself, and then discuss the issue with others if I can not get around it alone.</p>

        <h2>Week Six</h2>
        <p>Prompt:What did you choose the business/cause that you chose? Why do you think your redesign will
           be better? What area/content will you focus on in your redesign? Look at two other similar websites. 
           What stands out about those sites? what bothers you abut them? How will you improve things in your own 
           design.</p>
        <p>Response:<br> I chose to focus my rebrand on Pietro's Pizza, as I feel many aspects of the website feel dated
        and many of the images are extremely low res. There are also issues with photos linked to nonexistent pages and photos that "open up" when clicked on for no reason. 
      The existing branding is also not great, and I had rebranded them in my Studio 5 class. Utilizing this branding, I will create a more minimal and easy-to-navigate website and 
    customer experience. </p>
