        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: <br> For my project, I am planning on focusing on a hardcore band I enjoy called Knocked Loose. For content, I plan to give a brief overview of the band, their singles and demos, their first EP <i>Pop Culture</i> and their two studio albums <i>Laugh Tracks</i> and <i>A Different Shade of Blue</i>. Each page will be unique in content and photography, while staying cohesive in layout in the album-related pages. I plan to use a black, white, and blue color palette, bold typography, and gritty black and white concert photos to give the feeling of the band and recall thhe palette of their newest album, <i>A Different Shade of Blue</i>.</p>
