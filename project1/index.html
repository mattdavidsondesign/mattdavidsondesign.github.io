            Bryan Garris, the band's lead vocalist, has described their sound as 
            being "sandwiched between hardcore and metalcore", although he has 
            stated that the band's intention was to produce a diverse sound that 
            was difficult to categorize. Knocked Loose have been credited as one 
            of the forerunners of the first-wave metalcore "revival" scene of the 
            late 2010s, alongside bands such as Code Orange, Counterparts, Kublai Khan, 
            Varials and Jesus Piece.</p>

            As is common within the metalcore and hardcore punk genres, Knocked Loose 
            incorporate slow-tempo breakdowns into their music.

          New Noise, when reviewing their debut album Laugh Tracks, described the band's sound 
          as being akin to "Comeback Kid at their heaviest with some added doses of Slayer riffs 
          and Code Orange-style malice".
