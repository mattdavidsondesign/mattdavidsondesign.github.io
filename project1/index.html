            Knocked Loose is an American hardcore punk band from Oldham County, Kentucky, 
            formed in 2013 and currently signed to Pure Noise Records. The band released 
            its first studio album, Laugh Tracks, on September 16, 2016 through Pure Noise Records.

            Knocked Loose have been categorized under several sub-genres by the media and 
            publications alike, these including metalcore, hardcore punk, and beatdown hardcore. 
            New Noise, when reviewing their debut album Laugh Tracks, described the band's sound 
            as being akin to "Comeback Kid at their heaviest with some added doses of Slayer riffs 
            and Code Orange-style malice".

        Bryan Garris, the band's lead vocalist, has described their sound as 
        being "sandwiched between hardcore and metalcore", although he has 
        stated that the band's intention was to produce a diverse sound that 
        was difficult to categorize. Knocked Loose have been credited as one 
        of the forerunners of the first-wave metalcore "revival" scene of the 
        late 2010s, alongside bands such as Code Orange, Counterparts, Kublai Khan, 
        Varials and Jesus Piece.<br>
        <br>
        As is common within the metalcore and hardcore punk genres, Knocked Loose 
        incorporate slow-tempo breakdowns into their music.
